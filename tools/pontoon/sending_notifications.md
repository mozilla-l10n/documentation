# Sending notifications in Pontoon

Pontoon allows you to send in-app notifications to contributors of a specific project. To do so, go to your project dashboard and select the [Notifications](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/pontoon-intro/notifications/) tab.

## Choose recipient teams

First you need to select project teams to send the notification to. You can select them manually or by using one of the available shortcuts:

 * **All:** all teams translating the project.
 * **Complete:** teams with all strings translated in the project.
 * **Incomplete:** teams that have untranslated strings in the project.

All project contributors from selected teams will receive the notification.

You need to select at least one team.

### Enter notification message

Next, enter the message you’d like to send. You can use HTML tags. Try to be concise and use HTML wisely.

### Send

To send the notification, simply click the **Send** button and wait for the confirmation message to appear. It might take a moment. Once notifications are sent, you’ll be redirected to the Sent notifications panel.
