# Inquiries about joining Mozilla L10n

Here you’ll find a stockpile of templated responses to inquiries we frequently receive about Mozilla L10n. They’ve been centralized here so that you can simply copy and paste them into emails. While there is value to having these stock responses for common inquiries, we strongly feel that there is equal value to making them as personalized as possible. Take time to adjust the template in your email to include personalized information.

## Starting a new localization

Thank you for your email and welcome to the Mozilla Community! We’re excited that you’re interested in joining our localization effort.

Since you have stated that you would like to start a new localization effort, will be your mentor and point of contact.

Here’s how you can get started:

* Check our list of existing [localization communities](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/teams) to see if an effort for your language already exists. If an effort exists, contact the community to join the team and help drive the effort. If it doesn’t exist, introduce your new l10n community on the [Mozilla localization mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.l10n).
* Introduce yourself to the L10n community on the [Mozilla localization mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.l10n) by subscribing and posting an introduction. In your introduction, please add some brief information about yourself (e.g., professional background, interests, etc.) and what you hope to work on (e.g., "I saw that there was a xx-XX community and I’d like to help them out.").
* Visit [L10n process doc needed] to become familiar with how we localize.

For general information on the Mozilla localization program, visit our [GitBook link]. You’re also welcome to read through and post to  [the localization discussion newsgroup](https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.l10n/topics).
Hope to see more from you soon!

## Translation/l10n vendor sales pitches

It is a pleasure to meet you.

Mozilla is a non-profit, open source project. As such, all of our work, from development to marketing to localization, is performed by a dedicated, global community of volunteers. Our community is so thorough that it is very rare that we use vendors for translation, but when we do, we have a set of qualified vendors we rely on.

Of course, if you are interested in discussing a form of collaboration that fits with our volunteer, open source framework, I would be happy to arrange a meeting.

Thank you for your interest.
