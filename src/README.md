# L10n-drivers Documentation

This repository includes several documents describing how to perform internal tasks within the [l10n-drivers team](https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Mozilla_Team) at Mozilla.

Topics covered:
* How to [review strings](products/firefox_desktop/review.md) for Firefox desktop.
* Manage [other projects](products/other/) (Firefox Monitor, VPN Client).
* Perform common and advanced tasks on [Pontoon](tools/pontoon/) like adding new locale, and creating a new project.
* Other [miscellaneous documents](misc/) related to localization tasks.

## How to read these documents

You will need a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS) to run most of the tools. Across the entire documentation, commands to run in a terminal are described like this:

```BASH
$ composer update
```

`$` is not part of the command, it just indicates the terminal prompt. The command to type or copy and paste is simply `composer update`.

## Updating the documentation

Please see the [README file in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/blob/master/README.md).
