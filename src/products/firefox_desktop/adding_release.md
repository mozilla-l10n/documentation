# Adding a new locale to Beta and Release builds

## Prerequisites

The majority of the technical work has already been completed when setting up [Nightly builds](adding_nightly.md).

There are a few important prerequisites before adding a new locale to Beta and Release.

For the localization community:
* Localization should have reached a high level of completion, especially for user facing parts of the UI:
  * All [Tags](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/localizer-documentation/tools/pontoon/search_filters.html#tags) with high priority (4 and 5 stars) should be at 100% (or very close).
  * Lower priority Tags should be at least above 30%.
* Localization team has demonstrated a consistent effort, being able to keep up for at least a couple of cycles with the incoming flow of new strings.
  * There must be more than one active translator on the project, to ensure that the content has been peer reviewed.
* There is a relevant number of users on the Nightly channel testing the localization. This number varies based on the language, for minority languages 10-20 users is an excellent result. Also, a trend showing growth is important as well.

For the localization PM:
* Builds have been tested on different operating systems without identifying critical issues.
* [Searchplugins are set up](setup_searchplugins.md).

To track this work, you need to file a bug in Firefox::Build Config (like [this example](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1359321)), blocking the original tracking bug for the locale (`fx-l10n-LOCALE`).

## Create a Bugzilla component

Before filing a new bug, the localization team needs to provide the translation for `%LOCALE_NAME% Localization`, as the component description includes both English and translated versions.

Once that information is available:
* File a new bug following [this template](https://mzl.la/3jzjaza). Replace `%LOCALE_NAME%` with the locale name (e.g. `Lao`), `%LOCALE_CODE%` with the locale code (e.g. `lo`), and `%LOCALIZED_DESCRIPTION%` with the translation provided by the team. For example, for Lao the whole description will result in `Lao Localization (ການແປພາສາລາວ)`.
* Once the component is available, update the [GitHub tracking issue](https://github.com/orgs/mozilla-l10n/projects/3/views/1) with the link to this bug, and move all existing bugs from `Other` to this new component.

## Set up searchplugins

Check the [Set up searchplugins](setup_searchplugins.md) document for detailed instructions on how to set up searchplugins for new locales.

## Verify language name

The language name associated to the locale code is displayed in a few places in Firefox interface (language settings for web content, contextual menu for dictionaries). The language name needs to be defined in:
* [languageNames.ftl](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/locales/en-US/toolkit/intl/languageNames.ftl): ID with structure `language-name-LOCALECODE = (name of the language in English)`. Note that the locale code can only be a 2/3 letter code, locales like `ca-valencia` are not valid.
* [langpack_localeNames.json](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/action/langpack_localeNames.json): add the locale code with the `native` name, add `english` only if the English name differs from the native name. This list is used to generate language pack names and descriptions.
* [mozIntl.jsm](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/mozintl/mozIntl.sys.mjs):
  * Add the locale code in the `availableLocaleDisplayNames` constant, `language` [set](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/131338e5017bc0283d86fb73844407b9a2155c98/toolkit/components/mozintl/mozIntl.jsm#451).
  * Add the localized language name in the `nativeLocaleNames` [map](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/b3933df6e119bd6caf5d9e5868670348ec26dee3/toolkit/components/mozintl/mozIntl.jsm#650). The localized language name should also be stored in [this repository](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/firefox-languages/blob/master/output/languages_curated.json).
* [language.properties](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/intl/locale/language.properties): add a value in the form `LOCALECODE.accept = true`. This is needed to list the language in the language settings dialog for web content.

This is an [example of a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1807794) created to add this information. Don’t forget to update the GitHub tracking issue for the locale with a link to this bug.

## Add locale to build configuration

First of all make sure that your environment is [correctly set up](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/index.html#getting-set-up-to-work-on-the-firefox-codebase), update your local `mozilla-firefox` clone and make sure it’s on the `main` bookmark:

```BASH
$ cd ~/firefox
$ git checkout main
$ git pull
```

This is an [example of a recent bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1716987) used to track the build changes.

The file to modify is in `browser/locales/shipped-locales`, open it with your text editor of choice (in this example, Visual Studio Code).

```BASH
$ code browser/locales/shipped-locales
```

And add the new locale to the list. With Visual Studio Code, you can open the *Command Palette* and select *Sort Line Ascending* to make sure that the list is in **alphabetical order**.

After you’ve finished editing the file, check the status of the repository, and the diff. Let’s consider for example the task of adding Urdu (ur).

```BASH
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   browser/locales/shipped-locales

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

$ git diff
--- a/browser/locales/shipped-locales
+++ b/browser/locales/shipped-locales
@@ -83,14 +84,13 @@ son
 te
 th
 tr
 uk
+ur
 uz
 vi
 xh
 zh-CN
```

`+` in `git diff` indicates that the line has been added. Add all the changes using the command below:

```BASH
$ git add .
```

Then, follow the instructions available in [this document](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/contributing/contribution_quickref.html#to-write-a-patch) to create a patch, submit it for review, and land it.

You also need to set the `relnote-firefox` flag to `?` in the bug, the suggested comment is `Suggested for release notes: "Locale added: LANGUAGE_NAME (LOCALE_CODE)"`.

## Update language pack settings on AMO

The language pack for the new locale will be uploaded automatically by release automation on *addons.mozilla.org* (starting with the Beta version). A few follow-up manual steps are needed:
* The `Mozilla` account needs to be added as author for the language pack.
* The locale needs to be defined in [this JavaScript file](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/blob/master/src/amo/languages.js).

For the first step, an email needs to be sent to AMO administrators (amo-admins(at)mozilla.com).

These steps will make the language pack available in both the [Language Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/language-tools/) page and the API used by Firefox to add new languages from preferences.

## Close GitHub tracking issue

Once the locale ships to release:
* Create a new column for the Firefox version, e.g. `Firefox 91`, in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/mozilla-l10n/projects/3/views/1).
* Close the tracking issue and move it from `Queue - WIP` to this new column.
