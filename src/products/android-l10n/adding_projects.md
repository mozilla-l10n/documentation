# Adding a new project to android-l10n

Follow the steps below to add new projects to [android-l10n](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/android-l10n). You will have to coordinate with android-l10n developers and a technical Localization EPM throughout the process.

## Setting up the project in source and l10n repositories

Before anything happens, check that the new project is properly localizable by following the directions in [this section](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/blob/main/src/tools/pontoon/adding_new_project.md#adding-a-new-project-on-pontoon). Once the new project exists in its corresponding source repo and is properly localizable, it can then be added to the `android-l10n` repository.

Android developers need to create a TOML file in their code repository and under its corresponding project folder (example for Focus [here](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/focus-android/l10n.toml)), as well as as the file containing the source strings in `res/values/strings.xml` (example with Focus [here](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/c718159480512abf370abcfd5aaf54b1d81074d3/focus-android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)). The `firefox-android` repository contains all [current android projects](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/tree/main).

The TOML file should be pre-populated with a list of locales. When a new project is announced, the mobile PM typically reaches out to localizers on existing communication channels, so they can opt in their locale. If the Android project shares strings with `android-components`, then you need to first make sure the locale code is already listed under its corresponding [TOML file](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/android-components/l10n.toml). If not, it will need to be added there as well.

The `firefox-android` repository currently uses a [single workflow](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/.github/workflows/import-l10n.yml) (GitHub action) to import strings for all projects from `android-l10n`. Sync with mobile developers to make sure that the code to import strings for this project has been added.

On the `android-l10n` repository side, you will need to set up [automation](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/android-l10n/tree/main/.github/workflows) to import strings from the code repository. This automation will be responsible for creating all needed files in the repository. You may need to sync up with a technical localization EPM to set this up.

Once automation is in place, it will extract new English strings from the code repository. It should also be possible to invoke automation [manually](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/android-l10n/actions).

## Add the project in Pontoon

Once all of this is done and merged, you can now enable the new project in Pontoon. Instructions for adding new projects can be found [here](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/documentation/blob/main/src/tools/pontoon/adding_new_project.md#create-the-project).
