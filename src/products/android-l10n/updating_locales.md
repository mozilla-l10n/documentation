# Updating locales for specific projects

These are instructions in order to update locales to Android mobile products living within the [android-l10n project](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/android-l10n/).

## Edit the l10n.toml file(s)

All Android products live within the [android-l10n repository](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/android-l10n/). Depending on the product that requires a locale to be added or removed, the corresponding `l10n.toml` file will have to be edited by updating the list of locale codes in it.

The `l10n.toml` files live in their corresponding project folder, located here for:
* [Fenix](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/android-l10n/blob/master/mozilla-mobile/fenix/l10n.toml)
* [Android Components](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/android-l10n/blob/master/mozilla-mobile/android-components/l10n.toml)
* [Focus for Android](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/android-l10n/blob/master/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/l10n.toml)

Each l10n.toml file typically looks like this:

```
basepath = "."

locales = [
    "an",
    "ar",
    "as",
    "ast",
    "az",
...
]

[env]

[[paths]]
  reference = "app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml"
  l10n = "app/src/main/res/values-{android_locale}/strings.xml"
```

Identify the `locales` section, add or update the desired locale code in this list, making sure that the list is in **alphabetical order**.

Save your edited file, then commit and push from your local clone to the `android-l10n` repository.

Note that:
* All products share strings with Android Components, so you will also have to edit the Android Components `l10n.toml` file as well if itâ€™s a brand new locale.
* In case of removal of a locale, files need to be manually removed from the repository.

## Updating locales in Pontoon

Once the patch has landed, the locale has to be added - or removed - in Pontoon as well. The steps to follow can be found in the existing [Pontoon documentation here](../../tools/pontoon/adding_new_locale.md).

One thing to note is that, once you merge the pull request (PR) adding or removing locales in the l10n repository, automation will send that updated list over to the [code repository](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android). However use caution, as the next string quarantine PRs you receive might try to undo your changes (example of Fenix `l10n.toml` [here](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/blob/main/fenix/l10n.toml), and more information about string quarantine PRs [here](review_android_strings.md)).

You can know the status of l10n imports by checking the list of [closed pull requests](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-android/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+Import+translations+) in `firefox-android`.
