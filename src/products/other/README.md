To add a new locale to this project itâ€™s enough to add the locale to Pontoon. This will make the locale automatically available on the dev server and commit to the repository.

For production, locales need to be added to a list that is stored in a private repository, so a new issue needs to be filed ([example](https://github.com/mozilla/blurts-server/issues/1332)).
