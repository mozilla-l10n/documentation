# Screenshots

We provide localizers with regularly updated screenshots, which are currently maintained by the iOS Test Engineering team.

For every release, updated screenshots are provided twice: one week after string freeze (date shown on the current Nightly page) and one week before the Release Candidate (RC) (date shown on the Beta page). Both dates are part of the same [release calendar](https://whattrainisitnow.com/) used for Firefox and Firefox for Android. The latest iterations of screenshots can be found [here](https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/index/mobile.v2.firefox-ios.l10n-screenshots.latest).

Localizers can access these screenshots at any time through the link in the `RESOURCES` section of the [Firefox for iOS](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/firefox-for-ios/) project in Pontoon, located in the top-left corner of the page. There is no need to reach out to localizers every time new screenshots are added unless it’s for a special case — such as the launch of an important new feature. When necessary, you can announce screenshot updates in the l10n-community channel on Matrix [here](https://matrix.to/#/#l10n-community:mozilla.org).

If you encounter any issues with the screenshots, contact the team in the Slack [#l10n-test-eng](https://mozilla.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C01CUE8UH96) channel for assistance. The ePM responsible for mobile should be available in the channel for questions and to coordinate with the test engineers in case any issues arise.
