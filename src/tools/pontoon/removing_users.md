# Removing Pontoon users

Access Djangoâ€™s admin interface at `https://pontoon.mozilla.org/a/` (note that this is not the usual admin interface), then click `Users`. In the next page search for the user you want to remove (safer to search by email address):

* Click on the user among the results displayed under the search field.
* Click `Delete` at the bottom of the page.
* A confirmation page will appear with the list of user data to be deleted. We make sure the relevant data like translations and comments are kept. Click `Yes` to proceed.

Note that you can also delete multiple users at once by selecting the checkboxes and choosing the `Delete selected users` action from the dropdown.
