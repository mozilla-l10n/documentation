# Sending emails and notifications in Pontoon

Pontoon allows you to send emails and in-app notifications to contributors, with advanced filtering options.

## Access the Messaging Center

To send emails or notifications, go to the Messaging Center on Pontoon by selecting the [Messaging](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/messaging/) tab, which is accessible from the main Pontoon UI when logged in with an account with staff permissions.

## Message type

Once in the Messaging Center, you will be able to choose your message type at the top of the page. You can choose to send as a `Notification`, an `Email`, or both (by selecting both types).

By default, emails will only be sent to users who have opted into `News and updates` in their settings. However, if the message is considered transactional (e.g. an email about a password reset) then the `Transactional` option can be selected and emails will also be sent to users who have not opted in to email communication.

Note: Messages marked as Notification are not currently included in Email digests.


## Message Content

Next, enter your message using the Subject and Body fields. Links will be rendered as clickable when the message is sent. Markdown is supported for advanced formatting, such as embedding a link within a word.

## Choose recipients

You can send messages to a wide range of targeted groups by applying precise filters.

### Filter options

* By user role\
Select whether you’d like to send your message to Managers, Translators, Contributors, or all of them.

* By locale\
All locales are included by default and are listed under the “Chosen” column to the right. You can choose to remove a subset of locales by clicking on them one by one, so they get moved to the “Available” column to the left. You can also use the “MOVE ALL” options to move all locales from one column to the other.

* By project\
All projects are included by default and are listed under the “Chosen” column to the right. You can choose to remove a subset of projects by clicking on them one by one, so they get moved to the “Available” column to the left. You can also use the “MOVE ALL” options to move all projects from one column to the other.

* By submitted translations\
Set minimum and maximum thresholds for submitted translations, and/or select a date range for submitted translations.

* By performed reviews\
Target users based on the number of reviews they have conducted, using thresholds and/or date ranges.

* By last login\
Filter contributors based on their last login activity within a specific date range.

### Review and send message

Then, click on “REVIEW MESSAGE” at the bottom of the page to review your message content, recipients, and associated projects. You’ll also see a confirmation of the message type you’ve selected. You will have the option to either return to editing, send the message to yourself, or send it to the recipients. A confirmation message will appear at the top of the page once the message has been sent out.
