# Documentation

This repository includes several documents describing how to perform internal tasks within the [l10n-drivers team](https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Mozilla_Team) at Mozilla. If youâ€™re reading these pages on GitHub, a version with improved readability and search capabilities is available [here](https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/documentation).

Topics covered:
* Manage [Firefox for Android](/products/firefox_android) and [Firefox desktop](/products/firefox_desktop): setting up builds, bootstrap productization settings, and testing.
* Manage [App Store and Google Play](/products/appstores) content updates.
* Manage [mozilla.org](/products/mozilla_org) localization.
* Technical documentation and common tasks for our [webdashboards](/tools/webdashboards).
* Technical documentation for the [Stores web app](/tools/stores_l10n).
* Perform common tasks on [Pontoon](/tools/pontoon) like adding new locale, and creating a new project.
* Other [miscellaneous documents](/misc) related to localization tasks.

## How to read these documents

You will need a Unix-like environment (Linux, Mac OS X) to run most of the tools. Across the entire documentation, commands to run in a terminal are described like this:

```BASH
$ composer update
```

`$` is not part of the command, it just indicates the terminal prompt. The command to type or copy and paste is simply `composer update`.

In several occasions documents use aliases instead of the complete path to commands: for example `lang_update` instead of `path_to_langchecker_clone/app/scripts/lang_update`. Check [Setting up a Linux Virtual Machine for Webdashboards](/config/setup_l10ndrivers_vm.md) for instructions on how to setup a virtual machine running on Linux Ubuntu with all the necessary packages and aliases.

## Updating the documentation

Simply open a pull request adding the new file or updating an existing document. Make sure to follow [these style guidelines](misc/documentation_styleguide.md), and note that all pull requests need to be reviewed before merging.
