## Starting a new localization

Thank you for your email and welcome to the Mozilla Community! We're excited that you're interested in joining our localization effort.

If an effort exists, contact the team owner to join the team and help drive the effort. If it doesn't exist, introduce your new L10n team on the [http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.l10n.new-locales new locales newsgroup].
*Introduce yourself to the L10n community on the [http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.l10n.new-locales L10n newsgroup] by subscribing and posting an introduction. In your introduction, please add some brief information about yourself e.g., professional background, interests, etc.) and what you hope to work on (e.g., "I saw that there was xx-XX localization team and I'd like to help them out.").
*Visit [https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Localization_Process L10n process doc] to become familiar with how we localize.
*Visit the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_Quick_Start_Guide L10n Quick Start Guide] to find tutorials on how to jump in and start localizing.

For general information on the Mozilla localization program, visit our [https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n wiki home page]. You're also welcome to read through and post to  [http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.l10n/topics the localization discussion newsgroup].

## Localizing Thunderbird

We're glad to see you're interested in localizing Thunderbird and we're happy to help you get started.

Follow these steps to get involved:
*Check to see if your [http://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Teams l10n team] is already localizing Thunderbird & connect with the Thunderbird/mail toolkit owner about getting involved.
*Start localizing Firefox in your language. Hook up with your [http://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Teams l10n team], help them out to get used to the process and language, and then see if they want to extend to Thunderbird.
*If they don't want to extend to Thunderbird, see if they mind if you start a Thunderbird localization.

Our products follow essentially the same l10n process. Localizing Thunderbird is really no different. You use the same tools and work in the same timeframe. Review these to see how to get started:
*Visit [https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Localization_Process L10n process doc] to become familiar with how we localize.
*Visit the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localization_Quick_Start_Guide L10n Quick Start Guide] to find tutorials on how to jump in and start localizing.

## Translation/l10n vendor sales pitches

It is a pleasure to meet you.

Mozilla is a non-profit, open source project. As such, all of our work, from development to marketing to localization, is performed by a dedicated, global community of volunteers. Our community is so thorough that it is very rare that we use vendors for translation, but when we do, we have a set of qualified vendors we rely on.

Of course, if you are interested in discussing a form of collaboration that fits with our volunteer, open source framework, I would be happy to arrange a meeting.

Thank you for your interest.

## Phasing out locale

[%greeting]

I'm writing to you today to speak with you about the [%language] localization of Firefox and its state on the pathway to becoming an official localization.

Firefox is a complicated piece of software with a reputation of being a high-quality browser. Because of this, a lot is expected of Firefox from its users. To rise to this expectation, we ask a lot from localization teams for their work to become official Firefox localizations. As you know, we ask localizers to do the following on the path to releasing an official localization:

*keep up with the rapid release cycle (translate new product strings every six weeks),
*always be testing their localizations by being regular Aurora users,
*be active participants in bugs filed for their locale,
*and regularly maintain Mozilla web content.

Only when a localization team is consistently meeting these expectations, do we approve them for official release status.

This can require more than what some teams are able to give, in which case the teams have the option to release their work through addons.mozilla.org as language packs. This allows l10n teams the flexibility of contributing new translations when they have time available without the need to strictly meet the expectations mentioned above.

[%language] has been in the "officialization" process for quite some time and has been unable to meet the requirements to become an official localization. We believe that releasing [%language] as a language pack on addons.mozilla.org is the best way to honor the translations you've contributed and ensure that they reach the widest audience. This will also allow you the flexibility to continue to contribute translations as you have time available to do so. In the future, we're certainly happy to help mentor you through that process again. If you have more time available, or you find more Mozillians to help localize, and feel that the [%language] team can meet the requirements for becoming an official release, please reach out to [%mentor_name] again for their support and guidance.

[%goodbye]
