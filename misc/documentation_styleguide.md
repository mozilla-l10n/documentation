# Documentation style guide

## General rules

These are some of the general rules to follow when writing and reviewing documentation for this repository:
* Address the reader as **you**, avoid using **we**.
* Avoid using generic terms.
* Avoid unnecessary empty lines in the document.

## Typography

* Lists: each list item should start with an uppercase letter, and end with a period (only exception when the item ends with a URL). Use the `*` markdown notation for each item.
* Use lowercase after colons, only one space after a period.
* Use proper quotes, like `“example”`, instead of straight double quotes.
* Use typographical apostrophes `’` instead of straight single quotes `'` (code fragments are the only exception).
* Use backticks `, **bold**, or *italic* to highlight text in a sentence, not quotes.
* Use `*` instead of `_` for bold and italic.
* Try to use links instead of putting URLs directly in the text. For example, `visit [this page](http://example.com)` should be preferred to `visit http://example.com`.
* Leave an empty line before and after code fragments, specify the language where possible. For example:

<pre>
This is some text.

```PHP
$test = 'test';
```

This is some other text.
</pre>

## Titles

* Use the dash syntax, leave one space after the dash, e.g. `# This is a title`.
* Use sentence case, avoid title case.
* Documents should always start with a 1st level title. There should be **only one** 1st level title across the document.
* Leave an empty line before and after each title. The only exception is the 1st level title at the beginning of the page.
* Make sure to follow a logic when using titles, e.g. a 3rd level title should be in a section starting with a 2nd level title of its own.

This is an example of a good structure:

```
# This is the main title for this document

## This is a section

This is some text.

### This is a subsection

This is some text.

## This is another section

This is some more text.
```

## Bullet and numbered items

The first level has no indentation, and it’s completely aligned to the left. Sub levels should be indented using 4 spaces. Use `*` instead of `-` to create items. Example:

```
* The first level bullet point
    * A second level bullet point
        * A third level bullet point
```

## Links

There are three kind of links when cross referencing a document: within a document, within a project group, and outside a project group. The `[displayed text]` should be to the point and within a pair of square brackets. The displayed text must be followed by `(the link)` enclosed in a pair of parenthesis. Follow these formats for each case:

* Reference within the same document: link directly to the anchor, e.g. `[General rules](#general-rules)`. Note that GitHub automatically creates anchors for titles: if the title is *Title Example*, the anchor will be lowercase, with spaces replaced by dashes, i.e. `#title-example`.
* Reference within a project group: use relative links, instead of absolute links (starting with `/`) or full GitHub URLs. For example, to link to a document in the parent folder, use `[other document](../other.md)`.
* Reference outside the current repository: use the full GitHub URL, e.g. `[OpenDesign GitHub repository](https://github.com/mozilla/OpenDesign/tree/master/2017)`.

## Images

When adding images to a repository, make sure that the size is not too big for the content displayed on GitHub. In case of PNG files, make also sure to optimize files through online services like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

* Create a folder that maps to the main folder in which your documented is stored.
* Naming convention: if only a couple of images are needed, make the file name easily identifiable, e.g.: product_feature_type.png.
* File name must not contain spaces and uppercase, and must use underscore to separate words as needed.
* Image size: keep it under 800px. If necessary, create two versions: a small one and a bigger one to open when clicked.
* Image format: `![Encoding bug](/assets/images/l10n_testing/encoding_bug.png)`.
* When images contain personal information, such as email addresses, try to blur it out.

## Tools

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is the best tool for editing Markdown files:
* You can preview the content with `CTRL+SHIFT+M`. If you forget the shortcut, you can always use `CMD+SHIFT+P` to display the list of available commands, and search for `Markdown Preview: Toggle`.
* You can install a package called [smart-quotes-plus](https://atom.io/packages/smart-quotes-plus), which lets you swap straight quotes with curly ones. Once the package is installed, press `CTRL+ALT+'` to swap quotes on the entire document, or the text currently selected. Again, you can use `CMD+SHIFT+P` and search for `Smart Quote Plus: Smartreplace`. Only make sure to not swap `"` or `'` in code fragments where these characters are wanted.

To install packages in Atom, open the Preferences, select the *Install* panel on the left and search for the package you’re interested in.

[markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint), a Markdown linter, is run on automation (Travis) for each pull request. If you want to use this tool on your system, make sure to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run the following commands from the root of your repository (only once):

```BASH
$ git clone https://github.com/flodolo/l10ndocs-linter
$ npm --prefix ./l10ndocs-linter install ./l10ndocs-linter
```

At this point you can launch the linter with this command:

```BASH
$ node l10ndocs-linter/linter/markdownlint.js
Using config file: /your_path/documentation/l10ndocs-linter/linter/markdownlint.json
Searching path: /your_path/documentation

There are no linter errors.
```
